# Clone Website

You are about to reverse-engineer **$ARGUMENTS** and, unless page output is disabled,
rebuild it as a pixel-perfect clone.

Every run first emits and validates a portable **OpenDesign design system** at
`design-systems/<slug>/` (see
[Phase 2](#phase-2-emit-and-validate-the-design-system-always-on)). The optional page
builder consumes that package; it never invents a parallel token source.

Command surface:

```text
/clone-website <url1> [<url2> ...] [--build astro|nextjs|none] [--slug <name>]
```

- `--build astro` is the default and builds the root Astro app.
- `--build nextjs` builds the retained target under `templates/nextjs/`.
- `--build none` emits and validates the design system, then stops before page work.
- `--slug` overrides the normalized hostname. It is valid only with one URL.

When multiple URLs are provided, process them independently and in parallel where possible, while keeping each site's extraction artifacts isolated in dedicated folders (for example, `docs/research/<hostname>/`).

For page targets, this is not a two-phase process (inspect then build). You are a
**foreman walking the job site** — once the global extraction has produced a valid
design system, inspect each section, write a detailed specification, and hand it to a
specialist builder with everything it needs. Section extraction and construction then
happen in parallel, while the emitted package remains the styling source of truth.

## Scope Defaults

The target is whatever page `$ARGUMENTS` resolves to. Clone exactly what's visible at that URL. Unless the user specifies otherwise, use these defaults:

- **Fidelity level:** Pixel-perfect — exact match in colors, spacing, typography, animations
- **In scope:** Visual layout and styling, component structure and interactions, responsive design, mock data for demo purposes
- **Out of scope:** Real backend / database, authentication, real-time features, SEO optimization, accessibility audit
- **Customization:** None — pure emulation
- **Build target:** Astro

If the user provides additional instructions (specific fidelity level, customizations, extra context), honor those over the defaults.

## Browser Backend (pick one)

This skill needs a real browser for screenshots, computed-style extraction, clicks, scrolling, and hovers. Pick one backend during Pre-Flight and use it consistently. The extraction scripts in this document are the same for both backends; only the way you execute each snippet differs.

### Option A — Browser MCP (default)

Use any available browser automation MCP: Chrome MCP, Playwright MCP, Browserbase MCP, Puppeteer MCP, or equivalent. Prefer Chrome MCP when several are available. This is the default, and it is what the rest of the document means by "via browser MCP."

### Option B — ego-browser (opt-in only)

[ego-browser](https://lite.ego.app/) drives a real, logged-in Chromium through a Node runtime. It is an external dependency on `lite.ego.app`; **never select it automatically or make it the default**. Use it only when the user explicitly opts in and a `/ego-browser` skill or `ego-browser` executable is available. It can compose multi-step browser work into one JavaScript pass and return only the requested fields, reducing tool calls and context use.

Run each pass through a Bash heredoc:

```bash
ego-browser nodejs <<'EOF'
const task = await useOrCreateTaskSpace('clone <hostname>')   // reuse this SAME space every round
await openOrReuseTab('<url>', { wait: true, timeout: 25 })    // timeout is in SECONDS
const data = await js(String.raw`(() => { /* use the extraction JS from this skill */ return obj })()`)
cliLog(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2))                          // cliLog is the only output channel
EOF
```

Wherever this document says "via browser MCP," use this translation:

| Browser MCP instruction | ego-browser equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Evaluate a snippet | `await js(...)` with a `String.raw` template; it returns a real JavaScript value. Do not `JSON.stringify` inside the snippet—serialize in the Node body through `cliLog`. |
| Take a screenshot | `await captureScreenshot()` returns a temporary PNG path (a string, not base64); copy it into `docs/design-references/`. |
| Set viewport to 1440 / 768 / 390 | `await cdp('Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride', { width, height, deviceScaleFactor, mobile })`; clear it with `Emulation.clearDeviceMetricsOverride`. |
| Click / hover / scroll | `await click('@N' or 'css')` / `await hover(...)` / `await scrollBy(px)`. |
| Observe the page / get element refs | `await snapshotText()` / `await pageInfo()`. |

Keep these constraints:

- `wait` and `timeout` values are in **seconds**.
- The Node runtime keeps no state between heredocs. Start every pass with `useOrCreateTaskSpace(<id>)`, using the same ID to reopen the task space and reuse its tab.
- `cliLog` is the only output channel.
- Builder agents in Phase 4 Step 3 never touch the browser. ego-browser is only for the foreman's extraction and QA.
- When the clone is complete, close with `await completeTaskSpace(<id>, { keep: false })`.

## Pre-Flight

1. **Browser automation is required.** Use Browser MCP by default (Chrome MCP, Playwright MCP, Browserbase MCP, Puppeteer MCP, or equivalent; prefer Chrome MCP). If Playwright MCP is selected, configure its server command as `npx @playwright/mcp@latest`. Use ego-browser only after explicit user opt-in. If neither backend is available, ask the user which browser tool they have and how to connect it. This skill cannot work without browser automation.
2. Parse flags before URLs. Accept exactly one `--build` value from
   `astro | nextjs | none` (default `astro`) and an optional `--slug <name>`.
   Normalize a slug to lowercase kebab-case; without `--slug`, normalize the hostname
   after removing `www.`. Reject unknown flags, missing values, or `--slug` with
   multiple URLs.
3. Normalize and validate every remaining argument as a URL. If any are invalid, ask
   the user to correct them. Verify each URL through the chosen browser backend.
4. Verify the selected scaffold before extraction:
   - Astro: `npm run check`
   - Next.js: `npm run check:nextjs`
   - None: no page scaffold is required; verify both emitter scripts exist and
     `npx tsx --version` succeeds.
   The root must remain Astro; Next.js dependencies stay isolated in
   `templates/nextjs/`.
5. Resolve a compatible OpenDesign checkout before extraction. Prefer the absolute
   path in `OPEN_DESIGN_ROOT`; otherwise pass `--od-root <absolute-path>` to both
   design-system commands. Verify that the checkout contains
   `packages/contracts/src/design-systems/token-schema.ts` and
   `scripts/check-design-system-manifests.ts`. The default fallback only exists in
   the notes workspace at `knowledge/skills/open-design`.
6. Create the output directories if they don't exist: `docs/research/`,
   `docs/research/components/`, `docs/design-references/`, `scripts/`. For multiple
   clones, prepare per-site folders such as `docs/research/<hostname>/` and
   `docs/design-references/<hostname>/`.
7. When working with multiple sites in one command, optionally confirm whether to run
   them in parallel (recommended, if resources allow) or sequentially to avoid overload.

## Guiding Principles

These are the truths that separate a successful clone from a "close enough" mess. Internalize them — they should inform every decision you make.

### 1. Completeness Beats Speed

Every builder agent must receive **everything** it needs to do its job perfectly: screenshot, exact CSS values, downloaded assets with local paths, real text content, component structure. If a builder has to guess anything — a color, a font size, a padding value — you have failed at extraction. Take the extra minute to extract one more property rather than shipping an incomplete brief.

### 2. Small Tasks, Perfect Results

When an agent gets "build the entire features section," it glosses over details — it approximates spacing, guesses font sizes, and produces something "close enough" but clearly wrong. When it gets a single focused component with exact CSS values, it nails it every time.

Look at each section and judge its complexity. A simple banner with a heading and a button? One agent. A complex section with 3 different card variants, each with unique hover states and internal layouts? One agent per card variant plus one for the section wrapper. When in doubt, make it smaller.

**Complexity budget rule:** If a builder prompt exceeds ~150 lines of spec content, the section is too complex for one agent. Break it into smaller pieces. This is a mechanical check — don't override it with "but it's all related."

### 3. Real Content, Real Assets

Extract the actual text, images, videos, and SVGs from the live site. This is a clone, not a mockup. Use `element.textContent`, download every `<img>` and `<video>`, extract inline `<svg>` elements as React components. The only time you generate content is when something is clearly server-generated and unique per session.

**Layered assets matter.** A section that looks like one image is often multiple layers — a background watercolor/gradient, a foreground UI mockup PNG, an overlay icon. Inspect each container's full DOM tree and enumerate ALL `<img>` elements and background images within it, including absolutely-positioned overlays. Missing an overlay image makes the clone look empty even if the background is correct.

### 4. Design System First

Nothing can be built until the OpenDesign package exists and validates. Emit the
global tokens, component vocabulary, evidence, and derived caches first. Then wire the
selected page target directly to that package, add its types and global assets, and only
then dispatch section builders. This sequence is non-negotiable.

### 5. Extract How It Looks AND How It Behaves

A website is not a screenshot — it's a living thing. Elements move, change, appear, and disappear in response to scrolling, hovering, clicking, resizing, and time. If you only extract the static CSS of each element, your clone will look right in a screenshot but feel dead when someone actually uses it.

For every element, extract its **appearance** (exact computed CSS via `getComputedStyle()`) AND its **behavior** (what changes, what triggers the change, and how the transition happens). Not "it looks like 16px" — extract the actual computed value. Not "the nav changes on scroll" — document the exact trigger (scroll position, IntersectionObserver threshold, viewport intersection), the before and after states (both sets of CSS values), and the transition (duration, easing, CSS transition vs. JS-driven vs. CSS `animation-timeline`).

Examples of behaviors to watch for — these are illustrative, not exhaustive. The page may do things not on this list, and you must catch those too:
- A navbar that shrinks, changes background, or gains a shadow after scrolling past a threshold
- Elements that animate into view when they enter the viewport (fade-up, slide-in, stagger delays)
- Sections that snap into place on scroll (`scroll-snap-type`)
- Parallax layers that move at different rates than the scroll
- Hover states that animate (not just change — the transition duration and easing matter)
- Dropdowns, modals, accordions with enter/exit animations
- Scroll-driven progress indicators or opacity transitions
- Auto-playing carousels or cycling content
- Dark-to-light (or any theme) transitions between page sections
- **Tabbed/pill content that cycles** — buttons that switch visible card sets with transitions
- **Scroll-driven tab/accordion switching** — sidebars where the active item auto-changes as content scrolls past (IntersectionObserver, NOT click handlers)
- **Smooth scroll libraries** (Lenis, Locomotive Scroll) — check for `.lenis` class or scroll container wrappers

### 6. Identify the Interaction Model Before Building

This is the single most expensive mistake in cloning: building a click-based UI when the original is scroll-driven, or vice versa. Before writing any builder prompt for an interactive section, you must definitively answer: **Is this section driven by clicks, scrolls, hovers, time, or some combination?**

How to determine this:
1. **Don't click first.** Scroll through the section slowly and observe if things change on their own as you scroll.
2. If they do, it's scroll-driven. Extract the mechanism: `IntersectionObserver`, `scroll-snap`, `position: sticky`, `animation-timeline`, or JS scroll listeners.
3. If nothing changes on scroll, THEN click/hover to test for click/hover-driven interactivity.
4. Document the interaction model explicitly in the component spec: "INTERACTION MODEL: scroll-driven with IntersectionObserver" or "INTERACTION MODEL: click-to-switch with opacity transition."

A section with a sticky sidebar and scrolling content panels is fundamentally different from a tabbed interface where clicking switches content. Getting this wrong means a complete rewrite, not a CSS tweak.

### 7. Extract Every State, Not Just the Default

Many components have multiple visual states — a tab bar shows different cards per tab, a header looks different at scroll position 0 vs 100, a card has hover effects. You must extract ALL states, not just whatever is visible on page load.

For tabbed/stateful content:
- Click each tab/button via browser MCP
- Extract the content, images, and card data for EACH state
- Record which content belongs to which state
- Note the transition animation between states (opacity, slide, fade, etc.)

For scroll-dependent elements:
- Capture computed styles at scroll position 0 (initial state)
- Scroll past the trigger threshold and capture computed styles again (scrolled state)
- Diff the two to identify exactly which CSS properties change
- Record the transition CSS (duration, easing, properties)
- Record the exact trigger threshold (scroll position in px, or viewport intersection ratio)

### 8. Spec Files Are the Source of Truth

Every component gets a specification file in `docs/research/components/` BEFORE any builder is dispatched. This file is the contract between your extraction work and the builder agent. The builder receives the spec file contents inline in its prompt — the file also persists as an auditable artifact that the user (or you) can review if something looks wrong.

The spec file is not optional. It is not a nice-to-have. If you dispatch a builder without first writing a spec file, you are shipping incomplete instructions based on whatever you can remember from a browser MCP session, and the builder will guess to fill gaps.

### 9. Build Must Always Compile

Every builder must verify the selected target: Astro builders run
`npm run typecheck`; Next.js builders run
`npm run typecheck --prefix templates/nextjs`. After merging worktrees, run the
target's production build. A broken build is never acceptable, even temporarily.

### 10. Graceful Degradation Beats Total Failure

When a site is saturated with dynamic effects — heavy scroll-driven timelines, WebGL/canvas scenes, particle systems, dozens of staggered entrance animations — trying to reproduce every one of them perfectly in a single pass is how a clone goes from "almost done" to "completely broken." The motion chase introduces runtime errors, layout thrash, and an un-compilable build, and the user is left with nothing. Treat motion as a **layer on top of a correct static clone**, never as a prerequisite for it:

1. **Build the static skeleton first.** Get the DOM structure, exact CSS (in the element's resting/final state), real content, and assets correct so the page is visually accurate and the build is green — with zero animation. A static-but-pixel-accurate clone is a shippable success. A half-animated clone that doesn't compile is a failure.
2. **Layer motion back in priority order**, verifying the build after each addition: (a) effects essential to the layout being readable (sticky headers, reveal-on-scroll that controls visibility), (b) prominent hero/brand animations the user notices immediately, (c) decorative micro-interactions. Stop when the budget is spent.
3. **Use fallbacks for effects that can't be faithfully rebuilt.** A WebGL shader scene, a chained GSAP timeline, or a Lottie sequence is usually not worth reimplementing pixel-for-pixel. Capture it as a looping muted `<video>` or a high-resolution screenshot and place that in the layout. A convincing fallback beats a broken reimplementation.
4. **Record what was deferred or substituted** in `docs/research/BEHAVIORS.md` and the completion report. Never silently drop an effect — the user decides whether it's worth a second pass.

**Motion budget rule:** Cap reimplemented-from-scratch animations at roughly one significant effect per section. If a section needs more than that to feel right, the extra effects are fallback candidates, not build-from-scratch candidates. This keeps the build green and the clone shippable instead of chasing an unbounded animation surface until it collapses.

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance

Navigate to the target URL with browser MCP.

### Screenshots
- Take **full-page screenshots** at desktop (1440px) and mobile (390px) viewports
- Save to `docs/design-references/` with descriptive names
- These are your master reference — builders will receive section-specific crops/screenshots later

### Global Extraction
Extract these from the page before doing anything else:

**Fonts** — Inspect `<link>` tags for hosted or self-hosted fonts. Check computed
`font-family` on headings, body, code, and labels. Document every family, weight,
style, source URL, and license signal actually used. Map them to
`--font-display`, `--font-body`, and `--font-mono` in the design-system source;
the page target consumes those variables.

**Colors** — Extract the palette from computed styles across the page. Map roles
onto OpenDesign slots (`--bg`, `--surface`, `--fg`, `--muted`, `--accent`, and
the rest of the schema) in `tokens.source.json`. Do not create framework-specific
color values in a page stylesheet.

**Favicons & Meta** — Record favicons, apple-touch icons, OG images, webmanifest,
page title, description, locale, and social metadata. Download them into the selected
target's `public/seo/` during Phase 3.

**Global UI patterns** — Identify site-wide CSS or JS: custom scrollbar hiding,
scroll-snap on the page container, global keyframes, backdrop filters, gradients used
as overlays, and **smooth scroll libraries** (Lenis, Locomotive Scroll — check for
`.lenis`, `.locomotive-scroll`, or custom containers). Record them in
`BEHAVIORS.md`; implement only after the static target foundation is green.

### Mandatory Interaction Sweep

This is a dedicated pass AFTER screenshots and BEFORE anything else. Its purpose is to discover every behavior on the page — many of which are invisible in a static screenshot.

**Scroll sweep:** Scroll the page slowly from top to bottom via browser MCP. At each section, pause and observe:
- Does the header change appearance? Record the scroll position where it triggers.
- Do elements animate into view? Record which ones and the animation type.
- Does a sidebar or tab indicator auto-switch as you scroll? Record the mechanism.
- Are there scroll-snap points? Record which containers.
- Is there a smooth scroll library active? Check for non-native scroll behavior.

**Click sweep:** Click every element that looks interactive:
- Every button, tab, pill, link, card
- Record what happens: does content change? Does a modal open? Does a dropdown appear?
- For tabs/pills: click EACH ONE and record the content that appears for each state

**Hover sweep:** Hover over every element that might have hover states:
- Buttons, cards, links, images, nav items
- Record what changes: color, scale, shadow, underline, opacity

**Responsive sweep:** Test at 3 viewport widths via browser MCP:
- Desktop: 1440px
- Tablet: 768px
- Mobile: 390px
- At each width, note which sections change layout (column → stack, sidebar disappears, etc.) and at approximately which breakpoint the change occurs.

Save all findings to `docs/research/BEHAVIORS.md`. This is your behavior bible — reference it when writing every component spec.

### Motion Complexity Triage

Right after the interaction sweep — before mapping topology — classify how much dynamic effect the page carries and pick a strategy. This is the step that keeps an effect-saturated site from collapsing the whole clone (see Principle 10).

**Detect the animation stack.** Check the DOM and network/bundle for these signals and record each in `BEHAVIORS.md`:

| Signal | Library / technique | Default strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data-framer-*`, `framer-motion` in bundles | Framer Motion | Next.js: reimplement; Astro: prefer CSS/native script, use an isolated hydrated framework island only if essential |
| `gsap`, `ScrollTrigger`, `data-scroll` pins | GSAP / ScrollTrigger | Reimplement simple tweens; **fallback** complex pinned timelines |
| `.lenis`, `.locomotive-scroll` | Smooth scroll | Reimplement (Lenis is a small dependency) |
| `<canvas>`, `three`, WebGL context | Three.js / WebGL / canvas | **Fallback to looping video or screenshot** — do not rebuild |
| `.lottie`, `lottie-web`, `dotlottie` | Lottie | Reuse the original asset with a lightweight player/island, or fallback video |
| Many particles / cursor trails / shader background | Custom canvas / particles | **Fallback** — decorative, not worth rebuilding |
| `<video autoplay loop muted>` as background | Native video | Download and reuse directly |

**Pick a tier** and record it at the top of `BEHAVIORS.md`:

- **Light** (a few CSS transitions, hover states): reproduce everything inline as you build.
- **Moderate** (scroll reveals, sticky header, a carousel, one hero animation): static skeleton first, then layer motion per section.
- **Heavy** (WebGL/canvas scenes, chained GSAP timelines, dozens of staggered animations): **static-first is mandatory.** Build the whole page static and green, then add only budgeted effects (Principle 10) and substitute fallbacks for the rest.

When unsure of a site's tier, treat it as one level heavier — it is cheaper to add an animation back than to debug why an over-animated build won't compile.

### Page Topology
Map out every distinct section of the page from top to bottom. Give each a working name. Document:
- Their visual order
- Which are fixed/sticky overlays vs. flow content
- The overall page layout (scroll container, column structure, z-index layers)
- Dependencies between sections (e.g., a floating nav that overlays everything)
- **The interaction model** of each section (static, click-driven, scroll-driven, time-driven)

Save this as `docs/research/PAGE_TOPOLOGY.md` — it becomes your assembly blueprint.

## Phase 2: Emit and Validate the Design System (always-on)

Do this sequentially before touching page components. Every run emits
`design-systems/<slug>/`, including `--build none`.

### Step 1 — Serialize the extracted tokens

Write `design-systems/<slug>/source/tokens.source.json`, mapping the values already
extracted onto `themes.light` and, when present, `themes.dark`. List only slots with a
real or derived value; the emitter fills the rest through OpenDesign's A2 fallbacks and
B-slot aliases. Each entry records `value`, `confidence`
(`high | derived | fallback`), and a source citation (`file:line` or selector).

Every OpenDesign A1 slot needs a real value. Never hardcode the schema or copy shadcn
slot names: the emitter reads OpenDesign's `TOKEN_SCHEMA` at build time.

### Step 2 — Author the rich package

Author these evidence-backed files:

- `DESIGN.md` — at least seven substantive `##` sections covering personality,
  color roles, typography, spacing/layout, components and states, motion,
  accessibility, and anti-patterns.
- `USAGE.md` — `## Read Order`, `## Design Highlights`, `## Do`, `## Avoid`.
- `components.html` — at least ten selectors, eight declared `var(--…)` references,
  and four component groups, with no undeclared token reference.
- `preview/{colors,typography,spacing}.html`.
- `source/evidence.md` — provenance and per-token confidence notes.

### Step 3 — Emit, validate, then route

```bash
npx tsx scripts/emit-design-system.ts --brand <slug> --name "<Name>" \
  --category "<Category>" --od-root <open-design-root>
npx tsx scripts/validate-design-system.ts --brand <slug> \
  --od-root <open-design-root>
```

The emitter writes `tokens.css` and, through OpenDesign's own renderers, the derived
`design-tokens.json`, `tailwind-v4.css`, `components.manifest.json`, `manifest.json`,
and `source/token-contract.report.json`. Never hand-edit derived files; edit source
evidence and re-emit.

Validation is the gate. If it fails, fix the package before page work. For
`--build none`, report the validated package and stop here.

## Phase 3: Target Foundation Build

This is sequential and is done by the foreman, not a section builder.

### Astro target (default)

1. Make the first line of `src/styles/global.css`
   `@import "../../design-systems/<slug>/tokens.css";`. Do not copy token values,
   add Tailwind, or add shadcn.
2. Update metadata and language in `src/pages/index.astro`.
3. Create shared content interfaces under `src/types/`. Extract deduplicated SVGs
   as semantic `.astro` components or files under `public/icons/`.
4. Put only resets and truly global behaviors in `src/styles/global.css`; all
   visual values reference design-system variables.
5. Download assets into root `public/`.
6. Verify `npm run check`.

### Next.js target

1. Work only under `templates/nextjs/`; do not move Next dependencies back to root.
2. Set `DESIGN_SYSTEM_SLUG=<slug>` whenever running `dev`, `build`, or `check`.
   `scripts/sync-design-system.mjs` copies the emitted `tokens.css` and derived
   `tailwind-v4.css` byte-for-byte into the target's ignored build cache.
3. Keep `templates/nextjs/src/app/globals.css` as a bridge and global reset. It may
   map utilities to DS variables but must not declare independent color, type,
   spacing, or radius values.
4. Update `templates/nextjs/src/app/layout.tsx`, metadata, shared types, and
   semantic React SVG components; download assets into `templates/nextjs/public/`.
5. Verify `DESIGN_SYSTEM_SLUG=<slug> npm run check:nextjs` from the repository root.

For either page target, write `scripts/download-assets.mjs` to accept the target public
directory and download images, videos, fonts, and other binary assets in batches of four
with explicit failures. Preserve meaningful directory structure.

### Asset Discovery Script Pattern

Use browser MCP to enumerate all assets on the page:

```javascript
// Run this via browser MCP to discover all assets
JSON.stringify({
  images: [...document.querySelectorAll('img')].map(img => ({
    src: img.src || img.currentSrc,
    alt: img.alt,
    width: img.naturalWidth,
    height: img.naturalHeight,
    // Include parent info to detect layered compositions
    parentClasses: img.parentElement?.className,
    siblings: img.parentElement ? [...img.parentElement.querySelectorAll('img')].length : 0,
    position: getComputedStyle(img).position,
    zIndex: getComputedStyle(img).zIndex
  })),
  videos: [...document.querySelectorAll('video')].map(v => ({
    src: v.src || v.querySelector('source')?.src,
    poster: v.poster,
    autoplay: v.autoplay,
    loop: v.loop,
    muted: v.muted
  })),
  backgroundImages: [...document.querySelectorAll('*')].filter(el => {
    const bg = getComputedStyle(el).backgroundImage;
    return bg && bg !== 'none';
  }).map(el => ({
    url: getComputedStyle(el).backgroundImage,
    element: el.tagName + '.' + el.className?.split(' ')[0]
  })),
  svgCount: document.querySelectorAll('svg').length,
  fonts: [...new Set([...document.querySelectorAll('*')].slice(0, 200).map(el => getComputedStyle(el).fontFamily))],
  favicons: [...document.querySelectorAll('link[rel*="icon"]')].map(l => ({ href: l.href, sizes: l.sizes?.toString() }))
});
```

Then download everything to the selected target's public directory. Use batches of four
with proper error handling.

## Phase 4: Component Specification & Dispatch

This is the core loop. For each section in your page topology (top to bottom), you do THREE things: **extract**, **write the spec file**, then **dispatch builders**.

### Step 1: Extract

For each section, use browser MCP to extract everything:

1. **Screenshot** the section in isolation (scroll to it, screenshot the viewport). Save to `docs/design-references/`.

2. **Extract CSS** for every element in the section. Use the extraction script below — don't hand-measure individual properties. Run it once per component container and capture the full output:

```javascript
// Per-component extraction — run via browser MCP
// Replace SELECTOR with the actual CSS selector for the component
(function(selector) {
  const el = document.querySelector(selector);
  if (!el) return JSON.stringify({ error: 'Element not found: ' + selector });
  const props = [
    'fontSize','fontWeight','fontFamily','lineHeight','letterSpacing','color',
    'textTransform','textDecoration','backgroundColor','background',
    'padding','paddingTop','paddingRight','paddingBottom','paddingLeft',
    'margin','marginTop','marginRight','marginBottom','marginLeft',
    'width','height','maxWidth','minWidth','maxHeight','minHeight',
    'display','flexDirection','justifyContent','alignItems','gap',
    'gridTemplateColumns','gridTemplateRows',
    'borderRadius','border','borderTop','borderBottom','borderLeft','borderRight',
    'boxShadow','overflow','overflowX','overflowY',
    'position','top','right','bottom','left','zIndex',
    'opacity','transform','transition','cursor',
    'objectFit','objectPosition','mixBlendMode','filter','backdropFilter',
    'whiteSpace','textOverflow','WebkitLineClamp'
  ];
  function extractStyles(element) {
    const cs = getComputedStyle(element);
    const styles = {};
    props.forEach(p => { const v = cs[p]; if (v && v !== 'none' && v !== 'normal' && v !== 'auto' && v !== '0px' && v !== 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)') styles[p] = v; });
    return styles;
  }
  function walk(element, depth) {
    if (depth > 4) return null;
    const children = [...element.children];
    return {
      tag: element.tagName.toLowerCase(),
      classes: element.className?.toString().split(' ').slice(0, 5).join(' '),
      text: element.childNodes.length === 1 && element.childNodes[0].nodeType === 3 ? element.textContent.trim().slice(0, 200) : null,
      styles: extractStyles(element),
      images: element.tagName === 'IMG' ? { src: element.src, alt: element.alt, naturalWidth: element.naturalWidth, naturalHeight: element.naturalHeight } : null,
      childCount: children.length,
      children: children.slice(0, 20).map(c => walk(c, depth + 1)).filter(Boolean)
    };
  }
  return JSON.stringify(walk(el, 0), null, 2);
})('SELECTOR');
```

3. **Extract multi-state styles** — for any element with multiple states (scroll-triggered, hover, active tab), capture BOTH states:

```javascript
// State A: capture styles at current state (e.g., scroll position 0)
// Then trigger the state change (scroll, click, hover via browser MCP)
// State B: re-run the extraction script on the same element
// The diff between A and B IS the behavior specification
```

Record the diff explicitly: "Property X changes from VALUE_A to VALUE_B, triggered by TRIGGER, with transition: TRANSITION_CSS."

4. **Extract real content** — all text, alt attributes, aria labels, placeholder text. Use `element.textContent` for each text node. For tabbed/stateful content, **click each tab and extract content per state**.

5. **Identify assets** this section uses — which downloaded images/videos and semantic
icon components. Check for **layered images** (multiple `<img>` or background images
stacked in the same container).

6. **Assess complexity** — how many distinct sub-components does this section contain? A distinct sub-component is an element with its own unique styling, structure, and behavior (e.g., a card, a nav item, a search panel).

### Step 2: Write the Component Spec File

For each section (or sub-component, if you're breaking it up), create a spec file in `docs/research/components/`. This is NOT optional — every builder must have a corresponding spec file.

**File path:** `docs/research/components/<component-name>.spec.md`

**Template:**

```markdown
# <ComponentName> Specification

## Overview
- **Target file:** `<selected-target>/src/components/<ComponentName>.<astro|tsx>`
- **Screenshot:** `docs/design-references/<screenshot-name>.png`
- **Interaction model:** <static | click-driven | scroll-driven | time-driven>

## DOM Structure
<Describe the element hierarchy — what contains what>

## Computed Styles (exact values from getComputedStyle)

### Container
- display: ...
- padding: ...
- maxWidth: ...
- (every relevant property with exact values)

### <Child element 1>
- fontSize: ...
- color: ...
- (every relevant property)

### <Child element N>
...

## States & Behaviors

### <Behavior name, e.g., "Scroll-triggered floating mode">
- **Trigger:** <exact mechanism — scroll position 50px, IntersectionObserver rootMargin "-30% 0px", click on .tab-button, hover>
- **State A (before):** maxWidth: 100vw, boxShadow: none, borderRadius: 0
- **State B (after):** maxWidth: 1200px, boxShadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.1), borderRadius: 16px
- **Transition:** transition: all 0.3s ease
- **Implementation approach:** <CSS transition + scroll listener | IntersectionObserver | CSS animation-timeline | etc.>

### Hover states
- **<Element>:** <property>: <before> → <after>, transition: <value>

## Per-State Content (if applicable)

### State: "Featured"
- Title: "..."
- Subtitle: "..."
- Cards: [{ title, description, image, link }, ...]

### State: "Productivity"
- Title: "..."
- Cards: [...]

## Assets
- Background image: `public/images/<file>.webp`
- Overlay image: `public/images/<file>.png`
- Icons used: <ArrowIcon>, <SearchIcon> from the selected target's icon module

## Text Content (verbatim)
<All text content, copy-pasted from the live site>

## Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop (1440px):** <layout description>
- **Tablet (768px):** <what changes — e.g., "maintains 2-column, gap reduces to 16px">
- **Mobile (390px):** <what changes — e.g., "stacks to single column, images full-width">
- **Breakpoint:** layout switches at ~<N>px
```

Fill every section. If a section doesn't apply (e.g., no states for a static footer), write "N/A" — but think twice before marking States & Behaviors as N/A. Even a footer might have hover states on links.

### Step 3: Dispatch Builders

Based on complexity, dispatch builder agent(s) in worktree(s):

**Simple section** (1-2 sub-components): One builder agent gets the entire section.

**Complex section** (3+ distinct sub-components): Break it up. One agent per sub-component, plus one agent for the section wrapper that imports them. Sub-component builders go first since the wrapper depends on them.

**What every builder agent receives:**
- The full contents of its component spec file (inline in the prompt — don't say "go read the spec file")
- Path to the section screenshot in `docs/design-references/`
- The exact selected target and shared components it may import
- The target file path (for example `src/components/HeroSection.astro` or
  `templates/nextjs/src/components/HeroSection.tsx`)
- The selected target's verification command
- For responsive behavior: the specific breakpoint values and what changes

**Astro builder variant (default):**

- Emit one `.astro` component per section under `src/components/`.
- Write semantic HTML and scoped vanilla CSS. Reusable color, typography, spacing,
  radius, elevation, and motion values reference `var(--…)` slots from the emitted
  `tokens.css`. No Tailwind classes, shadcn, CSS-in-JS, or React wrapper.
- Static sections contain no client JavaScript. Their full content must exist in the
  built HTML.
- For small interactions, progressively enhance the server-rendered HTML with the
  component's standard `<script>`. If a framework component is genuinely required,
  keep its initial content server-renderable and hydrate with `client:visible` by
  default or `client:load` only when it must work immediately. Never use `client:only`
  for content-bearing sections, and never put a client directive on an `.astro`
  component.
- Verify `npm run typecheck` and `npm run build`.

**Next.js builder variant:**

- Emit `.tsx` components under `templates/nextjs/src/components/`.
- Use utilities exposed by the synced OpenDesign `tailwind-v4.css`; never recreate
  token values in component CSS or `globals.css`.
- Prefer Server Components. Add `"use client"` only for actual interaction.
- Verify `npm run typecheck --prefix templates/nextjs` and
  `DESIGN_SYSTEM_SLUG=<slug> npm run build --prefix templates/nextjs`.

**Don't wait.** As soon as you've dispatched the builder(s) for one section, move to extracting the next section. Builders work in parallel in their worktrees while you continue extraction.

### Step 4: Merge

As builder agents complete their work:
- Merge their worktree branches into main
- You have full context on what each agent built, so resolve any conflicts intelligently
- After each merge, verify the selected target's production build
- If a merge introduces type errors, fix them immediately

The extract → spec → dispatch → merge cycle continues until all sections are built.

## Phase 5: Page Assembly

After all sections are built and merged, assemble the selected page:

- Astro: compose `.astro` sections in `src/pages/index.astro`.
- Next.js: compose `.tsx` sections in `templates/nextjs/src/app/page.tsx`.
- Implement the page-level layout from your topology doc (scroll containers, column structures, sticky positioning, z-index layering)
- Connect real content to component props
- Implement page-level behaviors only after the static assembly is green. Preserve
  server-rendered content when adding scroll snap, transitions, observers, or smooth
  scroll.
- Verify `npm run check` for Astro or
  `DESIGN_SYSTEM_SLUG=<slug> npm run check:nextjs` for Next.js.

## Phase 6: Visual QA Diff

After assembly, do NOT declare the clone complete. Create durable side-by-side
comparison artifacts against the original:

1. Capture the original and clone at the same device scale, page state, and exact
   viewport width. Use 1440px desktop and 390px mobile; capture the full page.
2. Save the source captures and two composites under
   `docs/design-references/<slug>/qa/`, including `comparison-1440.png` and
   `comparison-390.png`. Each composite places the original and clone side-by-side.
3. Compare section by section, top to bottom, at 1440px, then repeat at 390px.
4. For each discrepancy found:
   - Check the component spec file — was the value extracted correctly?
   - If the spec was wrong: re-extract from browser MCP, update the spec, fix the component
   - If the spec was right but the builder got it wrong: fix the component to match the spec
5. Test all interactive behaviors: scroll through the page, click every button/tab, hover over interactive elements
6. Verify smooth scroll feels right, header transitions work, tab switching works, animations play
7. Re-capture both comparison artifacts after the final correction; stale
   before-fix screenshots are not acceptance evidence.

## Final Acceptance Gates

Run these gates after all visual fixes. They are the definition of done, not
optional follow-up:

1. **Design system — every build mode:** rerun
   `npx tsx scripts/validate-design-system.ts --brand <slug> --od-root
   <open-design-root>`. This must be a fresh passing run after the last edit.
   `--build none` performs this gate at the end of Phase 2 and stops there.
2. **Selected target — page builds only:** run `npm run check` for Astro or
   `DESIGN_SYSTEM_SLUG=<slug> npm run check:nextjs` for Next.js.
3. **Visual evidence — page builds only:** confirm both
   `comparison-1440.png` and `comparison-390.png` exist and reflect the final
   build.
4. **Behavior evidence — page builds only:** repeat the interaction sweep against
   the clone and record any deliberate motion fallback in `BEHAVIORS.md`.

Do not report the clone complete while any applicable gate is missing or failing.

## Pre-Dispatch Checklist

Before dispatching ANY builder agent, verify you can check every box. If you can't, go back and extract more.

- [ ] `design-systems/<slug>/` has been emitted and validation passes
- [ ] The selected target imports/syncs that package and its foundation build is green
- [ ] Spec file written to `docs/research/components/<name>.spec.md` with ALL sections filled
- [ ] Every CSS value in the spec is from `getComputedStyle()`, not estimated
- [ ] Interaction model is identified and documented (static / click / scroll / time)
- [ ] For stateful components: every state's content and styles are captured
- [ ] For scroll-driven components: trigger threshold, before/after styles, and transition are recorded
- [ ] For hover states: before/after values and transition timing are recorded
- [ ] All images in the section are identified (including overlays and layered compositions)
- [ ] Responsive behavior is documented for at least desktop and mobile
- [ ] Text content is verbatim from the site, not paraphrased
- [ ] The builder prompt is under ~150 lines of spec; if over, the section needs to be split

## What NOT to Do

These are lessons from previous failed clones — each one cost hours of rework:

- **Don't build click-based tabs when the original is scroll-driven (or vice versa).** Determine the interaction model FIRST by scrolling before clicking. This is the #1 most expensive mistake — it requires a complete rewrite, not a CSS fix.
- **Don't extract only the default state.** If there are tabs showing "Featured" on load, click Productivity, Creative, Lifestyle and extract each one's cards/content. If the header changes on scroll, capture styles at position 0 AND position 100+.
- **Don't miss overlay/layered images.** A background watercolor + foreground UI mockup = 2 images. Check every container's DOM tree for multiple `<img>` elements and positioned overlays.
- **Don't rebuild media or irreducible motion as elaborate HTML.** Reuse original `<video>` and Lottie assets directly. For WebGL/canvas/complex GSAP scenes that cannot be reused faithfully, capture a looping muted video or high-resolution screenshot and document the substitution in the spec and `BEHAVIORS.md`.
- **Don't approximate CSS classes.** "It looks like `text-lg`" is wrong if the computed value is `18px` and `text-lg` is `18px/28px` but the actual line-height is `24px`. Extract exact values.
- **Don't add Tailwind, shadcn, or framework wrappers to the Astro target.** Astro
  sections use semantic HTML, scoped vanilla CSS, and the OpenDesign variables.
- **Don't hydrate static content.** Astro emits HTML by default. Use a standard script
  for small progressive enhancements or `client:visible` / `client:load` only for a
  genuine framework island whose initial content is server-rendered.
- **Don't hand-edit `tokens.css`, `tailwind-v4.css`, `design-tokens.json`, or the
  Next target's synced design-system cache.** Change extraction evidence and re-emit.
- **Don't build everything in one monolithic commit.** The whole point of this pipeline is incremental progress with verified builds at each step.
- **Don't reference docs from builder prompts.** Each builder gets the CSS spec inline in its prompt — never "see DESIGN_TOKENS.md for colors." The builder should have zero need to read external docs.
- **Don't skip asset extraction.** Without real images, videos, and fonts, the clone will always look fake regardless of how perfect the CSS is.
- **Don't give a builder agent too much scope.** If you're writing a builder prompt and it's getting long because the section is complex, that's a signal to break it into smaller tasks.
- **Don't bundle unrelated sections into one agent.** A CTA section and a footer are different components with different designs — don't hand them both to one agent and hope for the best.
- **Don't skip responsive extraction.** If you only inspect at desktop width, the clone will break at tablet and mobile. Test at 1440, 768, and 390 during extraction.
- **Don't forget smooth scroll libraries.** Check for Lenis (`.lenis` class), Locomotive Scroll, or similar. Default browser scrolling feels noticeably different and the user will spot it immediately.
- **Don't chase animations until the build breaks.** On effect-heavy sites, get a static, compiling, pixel-accurate clone first, then layer motion back in priority order (Principle 10). A static-but-correct clone ships; a half-animated one that won't compile does not.
- **Don't dispatch builders without a spec file.** The spec file forces exhaustive extraction and creates an auditable artifact. Skipping it means the builder gets whatever you can fit in a prompt from memory.
